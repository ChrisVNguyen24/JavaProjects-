/* Shell of DVR.java.  
 *
 * The two recording ranges are given on the command line in military time.
 * The first two #s are the hours of the first range, and the second two #s
 * are the hours of the second range.  We assume that the first number of
 * each range is smaller than the second.  For example, "12 15 13 16"
 * represents recordings from noon to 3pm and from 1p to 4pm.
 *
 * Note that "12 13 13 14" is not an overlapping situation.
 *
 * Example execution:
 *   java DVR 12 15 13 16
 *   These times overlap: The second recording starts during the first.
